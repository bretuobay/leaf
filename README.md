## What is Leaf

Leaf is my personal attempt at a light weight PHP  toolkit for rapid prototyping.
 It was born as I needed a light weight personal toolkit to test and explore my personal understanding of PHP OOP
 patterns. I hope to continously improve it to make it tested  enterprise ready in the future.
